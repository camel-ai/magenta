{"problem": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably. Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$. The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$. Later, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.

{"problem": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably. Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$. The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$. Unfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35. Ross takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

{"problem": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group. It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make. | ARMLton | | | :--- | :--- | | Resident | Dishes | | Paul | pie, turkey | | Arnold | pie, salad | | Kelly | salad, broth | | ARMLville | | | :--- | :--- | | Resident | Dishes | | Sally | steak, calzones | | Ross | calzones, pancakes | | David | steak, pancakes | The population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}. A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad. Denote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$. For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups. For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$. A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.

{"problem": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group. It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make. | ARMLton | | | :--- | :--- | | Resident | Dishes | | Paul | pie, turkey | | Arnold | pie, salad | | Kelly | salad, broth | | ARMLville | | | :--- | :--- | | Resident | Dishes | | Sally | steak, calzones | | Ross | calzones, pancakes | | David | steak, pancakes | The population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}. A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad. Denote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$. For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups. For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$. A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
