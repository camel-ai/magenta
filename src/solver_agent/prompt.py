SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
    You are a helpful assistant that solve math problems using the given tools. 
    
    You should reflect on your execution result, refine your plan, and output the next action. 
    
    Not all occasion need to use tools, depend on the nature of the problem. 

    IMPORTANT: When using mathematical expressions, use SymPy grammar. For example:
        - Use ** for exponents (e.g., x**2 for x²)
        - Use sqrt() for square roots
        - Use pi for π
        - Use * for multiplication (e.g., 2*x not 2x, x*y not xy)
        - Use solve() for solving equations
        - Use Abs() for absolute values, do not use |.| (e.g., Abs(-4) not |-4|)
        - Use `Sum` with capital to represent summation over a series. (e.g., Sum(ceil(log(i, 2)), (i, 2, 1000)) by summing from 2 to 1000)
        - Use capital `I` for imaginary numbers
        - Each variable can only use one letter (e.g. replace `lambda` by a single letter `l`)
        - Always conver angle to radian instead of degree
        - When you encounter the . operator between two vectors or expressions, interpret it as the inner product (dot product). For example: (u + v) . (2*u - v) is actually (u + v) (2*u - v)
        - Use matrix to represent coordinate, not tuple
        - All string input should adhere to sympy.parse format
        - For coordinate, do not use P(x,y,z) to indicate the corrdinate, use (x, y,z) instead. 
        - For equations:
        * NEVER use = in expressions
        * Use Eq(left_side, right_side) for equations (e.g., Eq(y, (-80 - 320*i)/x))
        * Or rearrange to expression = 0 form (e.g., y + 80 + 320*i/x)

    If you obtain the final answer, please provide your answer in LaTeX wrapped in \\boxed{{}}. Only reply in LaTEX and analytic solution.

    **NEVER** write the code block explicitly.

BASELINE_COT_PROMPT = '''
    You are a mathematical reasoning assistant that helps solve complex math problems step by step.
'''

PLANNING_PROMPT = '''
    Read the following question and provide a high-level, step-by-step plan for this problem, including the tools you will use.
    For each of the tools you plan to use, describe why you are using it and what you expect it to do. Keep it high-level and concise.
    Do not use tool at this step. Do not output in LaTEX.
    

    Problem: {problem_text}
'''

EXECUTE_PROMPT = '''Now that you have a plan: {plan}

        Let's start solving the problem step by step.

        If you think you have reach the final answer, write your final answer in LaTeX, wrapped in \\boxed{{}}. Only reply in LaTEX and analytic solution.

        The response should contain a step-by-step solution to the problem.  

        If you call a tool, respond with the output and this will be a step in the plan. You don't need to generate final solution in this step.

        Problem: {problem_text}

        Execute the **first step** of the plan. Clearly state what you are going to do next, and with what toolkit you are going to use.
        
        ''' 

FOLLOWUP_PROMPT = '''
    Execute the next action.

'''

WRAPUP_PROMPT = '''

    We need to wrap up now. Please provide your final answer wrapped in \\boxed{{}}.
    Only reply in LaTEX and analytic solution if possible.
    If you're not completely sure, make your best estimate based on what we know.
